My personal website project. Ripped the idea off from [John Graham-Cumming](https://www.jgc.org). Took aesthetic inspiration from the 
[cypherpunk\cyberpunk](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) movement. Crypto support for wallets that inject the 
`window.ethereum` resource is included for fun. Thinking about adding a blockchain-based [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) 
feature.
